In a groundbreaking initiative aimed at tackling period poverty and its cascading effects on education, New Zealand has emerged as a leader, demonstrating a profound commitment to both environmental sustainability and educational equity. By providing free, sustainable menstrual products in schools, the country is addressing a critical barrier to education for many students, while simultaneously advancing its environmental goals. This initiative not only highlights the government's holistic approach to student welfare but also sets a precedent for how nations can address period poverty with an eye towards sustainability.

    The New Zealand government has recognized the dual challenge of period poverty and environmental degradation, launching a program to distribute free, sustainable menstrual products across schools. This initiative is part of a broader commitment to ensure that all students can attend school with dignity and participate fully in their education, free from the constraints and disruptions caused by inadequate access to menstrual products.

### Impact on Education and the Environment

The introduction of free, sustainable menstrual products in schools has had a tangible impact on student attendance and engagement. Preliminary data and anecdotal evidence suggest that the program has helped reduce absenteeism among students who menstruate, allowing them to participate more fully in their education without the added stress and discomfort of managing their periods without adequate resources.

Moreover, the initiative serves as an invaluable educational opportunity, raising awareness among young people about sustainable living and environmental responsibility. By normalizing the use of eco-friendly menstrual products, the program encourages students to adopt more sustainable practices in their daily lives, potentially influencing their families and communities to do the same.


### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite its successes, the initiative faces challenges, including ensuring consistent supply and access to these products across all schools and addressing the lingering stigma around menstruation that can deter students from taking advantage of the resources available to them. Furthermore, the program's long-term sustainability hinges on ongoing funding and support, underscoring the need for continued commitment from both the government and community stakeholders.

Nevertheless, the opportunities presented by this initiative are vast. Expanding the program could further enhance its educational and environmental impacts, serving as a model for other countries grappling with similar issues. Additionally, this initiative opens the door for partnerships with organizations focused on sustainability and menstrual equity, potentially leading to innovations in product design and distribution that could benefit communities worldwide.

## Conclusion

The EU's Ecolabel criteria for absorbent hygiene products mark a pivotal moment in the journey towards sustainable menstruation. This initiative not only reflects a growing environmental and health consciousness but also sets a new standard for the menstrual product industry. By embracing these criteria, manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers can collectively contribute to a more sustainable and healthy future. As consumers, choosing Ecolabel-certified products is a powerful way to support environmental sustainability and personal health, signaling a demand for products that are kind to our bodies and the planet.
